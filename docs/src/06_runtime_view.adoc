== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

****
In this section we will focus on developing which views of the webapp uses which microservices from the WIQ Services.
Mind that some of these processes works the same way when called from outside the system (look for them at the API docs)

=== Runtime Scenario: Signup

[plantuml,"Signup",png]
----
entity Webapp as "Sign in view"
entity Gateway_service as "Gateway service"
entity Microservice as "Authentication service"
database Users_database
Webapp -> Gateway_service: Sends signup form
Gateway_service -> Microservice: Forward the petition\nto the specific microservice 
Microservice -> Microservice : Checks the petition
alt data is valid
  Microservice -> Users_database : Check if username or email exists
  Users_database --> Microservice: Answers
  alt email is not registered nor username
    Microservice -> Microservice: Creates a respond with user's data
    Microservice --> Gateway_service: Forwards the respond
    Gateway_service --> Webapp : Responds to the petition
    Webapp -> Webapp : Logs into the application
  else email or username exists
    Microservice --> Gateway_service: Responds with an error
    Gateway_service --> Webapp : Forwards the petition
    Webapp -> Webapp : Show the error
  end
else data is invalid
  Microservice --> Gateway_service: Responds with some error(s)
  Gateway_service --> Webapp: Forwards the respond
  Webapp -> Webapp: Shows the error(s)
end
----
=== Runtime Scenario: Login

[plantuml,"Login",png]
----
entity Webapp as "Log in view"
entity Gateway_service as "Gateway service"
entity Microservice as "User service"
database Users_database
Webapp -> Gateway_service: Sends log in form
Gateway_service -> Microservice: Forward the petition\nto the specific microservice 
Microservice -> Microservice : Checks the petition
alt data is valid
  Microservice -> Users_database : Check if username exists
  Users_database --> Microservice: Answers
  alt users exists
    Microservice -> Microservice: Creates a respond with user's data
    Microservice --> Gateway_service: Forwards the respond
    Gateway_service --> Webapp : Responds to the petition
    Webapp -> Webapp : Logs into the application
  else users does not exist 
    Microservice --> Gateway_service: Responds with an error
    Gateway_service --> Webapp : Forwards the petition
    Webapp -> Webapp : Show the error
  end
else data is invalid
  Microservice --> Gateway_service: Responds with some error(s)
  Gateway_service --> Webapp: Forwards the respond
  Webapp -> Webapp: Shows the error(s)
end
----

=== Runtime Scenario: Generation of questions

[plantuml,"Generation of questions",png]
----
entity Microservice as "Question generator"
entity Wikidata as "Wikidata"
database Questions_database

group Repeats after some time
  Microservice -> Wikidata : Asks for information\nto generate questions
  alt Wikidata is working 
    Wikidata --> Microservice : Returns the information
    Microservice -> Microservice : Generates the question,\ncorrect answer and distractors
    group Transaction
      Microservice -> Questions_database : Removes questions that exist
      Questions_database --> Microservice : Confirms remove operation
      Microservice -> Questions_database : Saves the new questions 
      Questions_database --> Microservice : Confirms add operation
    end group
  end alt
  Microservice -> Microservice : Goes to sleep
end group
----

=== Runtime Scenario: Play a game

[plantuml,"Play a game",png]
----
actor User
entity Webapp as "Question game"
entity Gateway_service as "Gateway service"
entity Microservice1 as "Question service"
entity Microservice2 as "Record service"
database DB as "Questions database"
database UDB as "Users database"

Webapp -> Gateway_service: Sends a petition for questions\nwith some parameters
Gateway_service -> Microservice1: Forwards the petition
Microservice1 -> DB : Select some questions\nfor those parameters
alt Database is working
  DB --> Microservice1 : Retrieve some questions
  Microservice1 -> Microservice1 : Formats the questions retrieved\ninto JSON format
  Microservice1 --> Gateway_service: Responds with the JSON
  Gateway_service --> Webapp : Forwards the respond
  Webapp -> Webapp : Process the JSON and\nstarts the game
  loop Till there are no more questions
    alt Time has not run out
      User -> Webapp : Clicks an answer
      Webapp -> Webapp : Checks the answer
    end alt
    Webapp -> User : Show correct answer
  end loop
  Webapp -> User : Shows use the game statistics
  Webapp -> Gateway_service : Sends the statistics of the game\nFire and forget
  Gateway_service -> Microservice2 : Forwards the message
  Microservice2 -> UDB : Saves the record
  alt Users database is not working
    Microservice2 -> Microservice2 : Saves the record\nwill try with next request\nto save both records
  end alt
else Database is not working
  Microservice1 --> Gateway_service : Responds with an error
  Gateway_service --> Webapp : Forwards the respond
  Webapp -> Webapp : Process the error
  Webapp --> User : Advise in a friendly way\n(Oven cannot bake\nquestions right now) 
end

=== Runtime Scenario: Accessing a record
[plantuml,"Accessing a record",png]
----
entity Webapp as "Record view"
entity Gateway_service as "Gateway service"
entity Microservice as "Record service"
database DB as "Users_database"
Webapp -> Gateway_service: Asks for the record\nof the logged user
Gateway_service -> Microservice: Forward the petition\nto the specific microservice 
Microservice -> DB : Finds the user's record 
DB --> Microservice : Returns the user's record
Microservice --> Gateway_service : Sends the respond
Gateway_service --> Webapp : Forwards the respond
Webapp -> Webapp : Parses the record\nand shows it
