== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain concepts
==== Domain model

[plantuml, domain-model.png, png]
----
rectangle "Domain model"{
    class User {
    username : String
    email : String
    password : String
}

class Game {
    questions : List<Question>
}

class Question {
    question : String
    answers : List<Answer>
    correctAnswer : Answer
    language : String
    number : int
    questionType : QuestionType
}

enum QuestionType {
    POPULATION
    CAPITAL
    SIZE
    LANGUAGE
}

class Answer {
    text : String
    language : String
}

class UserData {
    answeredQuestion : Question
    chosenAnswer : String
}

class GameOptions {
    language : String
}

User "1" -[#red]-> "n" Game : plays
User "1" -[#red]-> "1" GameOptions : defines
GameOptions "1" -[#red]-> "1" Game : uses
Game "1" -[#red]-* "n" Question : has many
Question -[#red]-> QuestionType : is
Question "1" -[#red]-* "n" Answer : has many
Game "1" -[#red]-> "1" UserData : stores
User "1" -[#red]-> "1" UserData : stores
}

=== User experience concepts

==== Consistency
Design elements should be consistent throuhgout the design, so that the user does not get confused.

==== Progress indicators
Provide the users with some sort of progress indicator within the quiz. This helps users understand their current position in the quiz.

==== Feedback on correct or incorrect answers
Provide immediate feedback to users after they answer each question, indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect.

==== Internationalization
Provide language options other than english.


=== Security and Safety concepts

==== Secure storage
Make sure to never store the user passwords in plain text, to secure the users data.

==== Data encryption
Utilize encryption techniques to secure data in any transmission between actors of our application.


=== Architecture and design patterns concepts

==== Microservices
The microservices pattern combines design patterns to create multiple services that work interdependently to create a larger application. Because each application is small, it's easier to update them when needed. We will be using this pattern during development.


=== Under-the-hood concepts

==== Question and User Databases
To enhance consistency and reduce reliance on Wikidata, our project employs two distinct databases. The first database serves as a repository for questions generated via Wikidata's API, which are then utilized within the application. The second database stores various other datasets, including user information.


=== Developement concepts

==== Continous Integration
The developement will intent for the maximum possible code coverage, and to be deployed in an Azure Virtual Machine using Continous Integration.

==== Task branching
We should create 1 branch per issue and merge them as soon as possible.

==== Error handling
In case of an exception/error, the system will pressent user-friendly messages informing of the error. This messages will only be delivered in the worst case,  when all other attempts to resolve the issue have been exhausted.


=== Operational concepts

==== User history
The application will maintain a record of user game history, encompassing details such as game timestamps, earned points, questions posed, correct response and selected response.
