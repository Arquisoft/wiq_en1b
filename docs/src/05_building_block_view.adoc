== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Scope and Context

image::5-ScopeAndContext.svg["Scope and Context"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition of our system we present an overall view of it. This captures the whole system interaction at once without much detail.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *WIQ*: Resembles the whole system. Manages the interactions with the users and communicates with the outside services (wikidata).

=== Level 1

image::5-Level1.svg["Level 1"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition we separate the main services of our system showing how not every part of the system communicates with the exterior.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *_Webapp_* : The web part of our application that will use the wiq services to let the user play.
* *Gateway service* : Service that will redirect every call to our endpoints to the specific one.
* *_WIQ Services_* : Our collection of endpoints that will attend any need of our Webapp as well as giving support to external calls.

=== Level 2

image::5-Level2.svg["Level 2"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition of the system we identify the different views of the webapp and microservices of the WIQ services.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *_Webapp_ Home* : First view of the webapp.
* *_Webapp_ Log in and Register* : Views of the webapp that allow the user to get into the application.
* *_Webapp_ Game menu* : Intermediate view between the records and the actual game.
* *_Webapp_ User's games records* : View where the user will be able to see different statistics of the games played (Correct answers, points, total games).
* *_Webapp_ Question Game* : Game view where the user will be able answer the random question by choosing 1 of 4 posibilities.

* *_WIQ Services_ Authentication service* : Microservice that will let the user log in a created account. 
* *_WIQ Services_ User service* : Microservice that will let the user create an account.
* *_WIQ Services_ Record service* : Microservice that will manage the records of all users and will let anyone get the records of an user.
* *_WIQ Services_ Question service* Microservice that will get some random questions for an user game. It will also let anyone get random questions outside our system.
* *_WIQ Services_ Question generator* Microservice that will generate the random questions accesing wikidate and load them into the system.
