== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

=== Scope and Context

image::5-ScopeAndContext.svg["Scope and Context"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition of our system we present an overall view of it. This captures the whole system interaction at once without much detail.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *WIQ*: Resembles the whole system. Manages the interactions with the users and communicates with the outside services (wikidata).

=== Level 1

image::5-Level1.svg["Level 1"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition we separate the main services of our system showing how not every part of the system communicates with the exterior.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *_WIQ_ HOME* : Service which will collect the user interaction and redirect it to the corresponding service.
* *_WIQ_ USER MANAGEMENT* : Service that will manage the user information, login, authentication, etc.
* *_WIQ_ QUESTION GAME* Service that will generate and show the different questions for our game.

=== Level 2

image::5-Level2.svg["Level 2"]

Motivation::

In this level of descomposition of the system we start to identify the different microservices of the system.


Contained Building Blocks::
* *_HOME_ WELCOME PAGE* : Microservice that will welcome the user giving a small explanation about the game and facilate the registration/login process.
* *_USER MANAGEMENT_ USERSERVICE* : Microservice that will allow the user create an account for the user and let him access the game.
* *_USER MANAGEMENT_ AUTHSERVICE* : Microservice that will login the user in the system and let him access the game.
* *_HOME_ GAMEMODE PAGE* : Microservice that will let the user start a game.
* *_QUESTION GAME_ GAME CONFIGURATION* Microservice that will let the user customize some game parameters (amount of questions, time to respond a question, etc).
* *_QUESTION GAME_ QUESTION RESTAPI* Microservice that will work as our open API allowing other systems to retrieve information like:
  ** Random questions and corresponding answers 
* *_QUESTION GAME_ QUESTION GENERATOR* Microservice that will generate the different questions for our game communicating with wikidata.
* *_QUESTION GAME_ GAME* Microservice that will show the different questions for our game and manage the user answers in order to give a final score.
