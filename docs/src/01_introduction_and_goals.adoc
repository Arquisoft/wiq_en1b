== Introduction and Goals
The Spanish TV and news company RTVE has hired the software company HappySW to develop a web application based on the successful TV program "Saber y Ganar" called WIQ.
The application will be a trivia style game composed by a series of questions with multiple answers dynamically generated by the use of the WikiData API.

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview
The system will follow the functionality of the "Saber y Ganar" TV program, and so it will allow the users to select an answer between some options.
The questions and answers will be automatically generated using the WikiData API, that will also determine which of the answers is in fact the correct one.
The system will also store the historical data of the users and will be accessible through the web, thanks to the login and registering service featured in the application. 
The application will have at least English as available language. 
Apart from being in GitHub the system will have an API responsible of handling the questions generated previously from WikiData.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Quality attribute|Scenario
| Usability | The user must be able to understand the function of the application before the minute mark.
| Performance | The application will be able to operate within reasonable response times, taking into account the already present waiting times (time to answer, between questions, etc). 
| Security & Privacy | The information stored about a user can only be accessed by said user, never others.
| Robustness | The application will be able to handle any user error that could happen at runtime.
| Accessibility | The application will be accessible by all users, even if the suffer from visual impediments such as colorblindness.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
